This is a plugin lightens the mood of the MP6 Plugin. 


== Description ==

This plugin is my first attempt at making the MP6 Plugin have a lighter theme. 

It requires that the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/">MP6 Plugin</a> be installed and active. 

<strong> WARNING:</strong> Like MP6 this plugin is in it's early stages and is likely to change along with MP6.

Please get involved with the developement on github! 


== Other Notes ==

TODO: figure out moby.css and have the light theme play nice with the responsive layout.
